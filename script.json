Back in the 20th century, they were one of the first to market wine in a way that felt accessible—TV ads, billboards, catchy jingles. They weren’t just selling bottles; they were selling the idea that wine could be part of everyday life."

    "host": "Alex",
    "type": "speaking",
    "text": "And on the flip side, they’ve invested in luxury brands too—labels like Orin Swift, Louis M. Martini, and Talbott Vineyards. It’s not just jug wine anymore; they’ve got bottles for collectors and sommeliers."
